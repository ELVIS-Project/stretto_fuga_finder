# stretto_fuga_finder
Algorithm based on music21 for detecting stretto fuga patterns


## Description
This algorithm has been designed to detect imitations and stretto fuga patterns in two-voice duos, namely, the Josquin and La Rue secure duos.

The algorithm has been designed and implemented by Sylvain Margot with some help from Nestor Napoles

The code here requires the `music21` and `numpy` python packages

## Running the code
Clone the repository recursively (this is necessary for getting the `mass-duos-corpus-josquin-larue`, containing the data)

```
git clone https://github.com/ELVIS-Project/stretto_fuga_finder --recursive
```

Run the Stretto Fuga Finder script
```
python Stretto_Fuga_Finder.py
```
